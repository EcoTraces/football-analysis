# Changelog

## 2026-08-26 — Initial scaffold

- Created the repository and the full domain schema in Supabase/Postgres
  (`supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`), plus a clearly-flagged, isolated
  synthetic dev seed (`supabase/seed/dev_seed_synthetic.sql`).
- Built the backend API (Node/Express/TypeScript): health endpoints, a
  `FootballDataProvider` abstraction with a `NullProvider` default,
  fixtures/matches/teams/competitions/standings read routes, a prediction
  generation job, and admin endpoints to trigger it and check data health.
- Built the ML service (Python/FastAPI): a Dixon-Coles-adjusted Poisson
  goals model producing 1X2/BTTS/Over-Under-2.5 probabilities with
  sample-size-driven data quality and plain-language explanation factors.
- Built the frontend (React/Vite/TypeScript/Tailwind): today's fixtures
  list, match detail with prediction cards, dark/light mode, accessible
  freshness badges, responsible-gambling footer.
- Added unit tests across all three services (freshness classification,
  provider fallback, Poisson market math, prediction confidence, and
  frontend components) and a GitHub Actions CI workflow running lint,
  typecheck, tests, and build for each.
- Wrote the full documentation set (`PRD.md`, `Architecture.md`,
  `Database.md`, `Coding_Rules.md`, `Road_map.md`, `Task.md`, `API.md`,
  `ML_Model.md`, `Data_Sources.md`, `Deployment.md`).
